# What is this?
These are some of my Sinclair BASIC programs I did as a child on the ZX-81, which I converted to the C64. They are in german as I did them in german when I was a child. If you want to compare have a look [here](https://github.com/SJakubinek/ZX-81-BASIC-Programs)

## COUNT110
Just a very simple program. It counts from 1 to 10. But imagine you're 5.5 years old in 1981 and this was your very first own program. It was pure magic to me!

## CNT1100
As you had to force the ZX-81 to do a CLS after x lines, it wasn't necessary on the C64. Anyway I converted it.

## HALLO
"Hello World" ... The funny part about this is it wasn't my first program like it is usually. I even can't tell you why, but I think I ever liked math more then languages/words.

## 10HALLO
Well this prints "HALLO" 10 times onto the screen. Nothing else.

## RECHNER
I got into school and sadly we weren't adding numbers or substracting or whatever. No, instead we had to paint circles around things that were of the same type and count them. Boring! At home I wrote this little program, which I later may or may not have used for my homework. ;)

## RATESPIE
Usually you had to guess the number the computer picked. I made it the opposite way. Yes, you can cheat. But why you should cheat?!

## ELOPUNKT
I am honest. This one wasn't made by me, when I was a child. It was made in July 2024 for the standings of a virtual Soccer Cup, which I streamed and want to do again in two years. So this one is for calculating the points in a way FIFA does for the World Records of Soccer teams. See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Men%27s_World_Ranking#Calculation_method) for further details. Of course this program had to be written for the C64 as the Soccer Cup has been played on it.

## TIMER
This one calculates the time difference between the start of the program, loop or whatever and end of it.

## PRIMZAHL
This is just the sieve of Eratosthenes. Nothing special.

# About me
I started programming at the age of 5 1/2 when a ZX-81 moved into our house.

The first program I typed in was from a book and it was [Wolf, goat and cabbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem). Then I got addicted and wanted to learn more and more. Thankfully there was a manual in which all the commands where described with some examples.

When people asked me what I want to do for a living, when grown up I immediatly answered:"I wanna programm stuff!" So I followed this dream ever since.
